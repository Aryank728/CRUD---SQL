### Modules to Install

For the frontend (React):
```bash
npm install axios react react-dom
```

For the backend (Node.js with Express and MySQL):
```bash
npm install express mysql2 cors
```

### Project Overview

#### Frontend (React)

1. **App.js**:
   - This is the main React component for your frontend.
   - It manages the state for input fields like name, age, country, position, and salary, and updates them as the user types.
   - It sends POST requests to the backend to create new employees and GET requests to fetch and display the list of employees.
   - The form allows users to input employee details, and a "Show Employees" button fetches and displays the list of employees.

2. **index.js**:
   - This is the entry point for your React application.
   - It renders the `App` component in the root HTML element with the id "root."

3. **reportWebVitals.js**:
   - This file is used for reporting web vitals performance metrics. It's not directly related to the project's functionality.

#### Backend (Node.js with Express and MySQL)

1. **index.js**:
   - This is the main Express.js server file.
   - It sets up routes to handle POST requests for creating employees and GET requests for fetching the list of employees.
   - It uses the `mysql2` library to interact with a MySQL database.
   - The server listens on port 3001.

### How the Project Works

1. Users can input employee details (name, age, country, position, and salary) in the form provided by the `App` component.

2. Clicking the "Add Employee" button sends a POST request to the backend with the employee details, which are then inserted into the MySQL database.

3. Clicking the "Show Employees" button sends a GET request to the backend to fetch the list of employees from the database.

4. The retrieved employee data is displayed on the frontend, showing the name, age, country, position, and salary of each employee.
